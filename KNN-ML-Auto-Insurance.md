*KNN Model with Auto Insurance Data*

Clear working memory

``` r
rm(list=ls())
```

Fit a KNN model to the data from the Caravan auto insurance dataset
using outcome Purchase and all of the other variables in the dataset as
predictors.

``` r
# Write your code here
library(class) # package for knn classifier
Insurance_Data <- read.csv("AutoInsurance.csv")
attach(Insurance_Data)
#quick summary of data
colnames(Insurance_Data)
```

*Conclusion:* As k in the KNN increases, the success rate increases.
This makes sense as increasing amount of nearest neighbors decreases
variance, but also increases bias. There is a bias-variance tradeoff.
However, profits do not necessarily increase and go up with k. Profits
are higher when k=5 than k=2 or k=10 as the success rate is more optimal
in both chance and quantity. Hence, it is best to balance the variance
and bias, selecting an optimal amount of nearest neighbors that will
maximize profit (e.g.Â k=5).
